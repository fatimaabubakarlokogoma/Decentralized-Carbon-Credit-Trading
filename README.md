# Decentralized Carbon Credit Trading

## Overview
This project implements a blockchain-based platform for transparent and efficient carbon credit trading. The system enables verification, issuance, trading, and retirement of carbon credits in a decentralized manner, reducing fraud and increasing trust in voluntary carbon markets.

## Core Components

### Project Verification Contract
Validates carbon reduction initiatives through a rigorous multi-party verification process. Records methodologies, baseline measurements, reduction data, and third-party verification reports to establish legitimate carbon reduction claims.

### Credit Issuance Contract
Creates tradable tokens representing verified carbon reductions, with each token equivalent to one metric ton of COâ‚‚ equivalent emissions. Maintains immutable records of credit origin, project type, vintage year, verification standard, and additional environmental attributes.

### Trading Contract
Facilitates the buying and selling of carbon credits through transparent price discovery and efficient settlement. Supports various trading mechanisms including auctions, fixed price sales, and peer-to-peer transactions with complete provenance tracking.

### Retirement Contract
Permanently removes used credits from circulation once they've been claimed against emissions, preventing double-counting and ensuring environmental integrity. Generates immutable retirement certificates for compliance reporting and ESG disclosures.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies
3. Configure your blockchain environment
4. Deploy the contracts
5. Integrate with carbon accounting systems

## Architecture
The solution employs a modular design with contracts that maintain the integrity of the carbon credit lifecycle. All transactions are recorded on-chain with cryptographic verification of critical data points.

## Security Considerations
- Multi-signature approval for verification processes
- Cryptographic proof of retirement
- Tamper-proof project documentation
- Auditable history of all credit transactions

## Compliance
This solution is designed to align with established carbon market standards including:
- Verified Carbon Standard (Verra)
- Gold Standard
- Climate Action Reserve
- UNFCCC Clean Development Mechanism
